Temperature Converter version 2.0

The first app I ever made on my own was a temperature converter. It was clunky but it worked.

I decided to make another run at an updated version, this time incorporating a lot of the 
object-oriented principles I have learned since beginning. 

This app takes as input a temperature in numerical form and a temperature scale (Farenheit, Celsius, or Kelvin). 
The tempereature is then converted into the other two scales that were not chosen and, finally, 
the temperature is displayed in all three scales. 

The app also alters the background image and color scheme based on the current season (summer, fall, winter, spring).
